Big Data, what does that really mean? We see that term strewn throughout our modern technology
oriented world as if it holds the fabric of all that comes from Silicon Valley. For the regular
financial investor, however, this term doesn’t really provide anything for them. Big Data is for,
well, Big Companies and Big People who can invest thousands of dollars into advanced research tools.

Here at AcroMetrics, we want to bring the great benefits of Big Data down the regular consumer.
We realize that all the data we need is already publically available, but instead of it being properly
curated, it is dispersed like a vast ocean. We strive to provide amateur investors tools and techniques
to help them navigate this ‘ocean of data’ so they can make more informed trading decisions.
